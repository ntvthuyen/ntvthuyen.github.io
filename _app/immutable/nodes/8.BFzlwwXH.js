Computers, being it your laptop or smartphone, require significant attention from us to operate. Every time you look down to text on your phone screen is a moment you disengage from reality. This is due to the lack of intuitive and implicit input capabilities for computer and such minuscule but repetitive behavior have turned people to prefer keyboards and screens over talking and interacting with the physical world. Over the past decade, there have been significant efforts in addressing this challenge via brave new interactive modalities that could weave seamlessly into our life such as smart glasses, smart rings, smart speakers, etc. In this thesis, we set forth to extend this line of research for intuitive, effortless, and enjoyable computer interaction by employing a natural everyday-carry object – the smartwatch. We look for extending the capability of the smartwatch beyond what it already is, i.e., a timepiece and mostly a health monitor, and become a mean to facilitate an effortless human-computer away from mice and keyboards. We follow through, first by enhancing the capability of the smartwatch; then we propose a technique for activity recognition using inertial motion signals from the smartwatch; and finally, we implement a flexible authentication framework for multiple platforms authentication using wearable devices that are highly customizable.",x,p,O='<a href="#video">Video</a>',T,v,R='<a href="#authentication-using-hand-gesture">Authentication using hand gesture</a>',C,g,V="The PC will open a corresponding Windows profile.",j,b,k,H,M,y,D='<a href="#authentication-using-body-movement">Authentication using body movement</a>',P,_,q,I,L;return b=new J({props:{youTubeId:"8MzSac85qMY"}}),_=new J({props:{youTubeId:"o3U5qsOYM6U"}}),{c(){t=h("h2"),t.innerHTML=f,l=m(),r=h("p"),r.textContent=i,s=m(),u=h("p"),u.textContent=E,x=m(),p=h("h2"),p.innerHTML=O,T=m(),v=h("h3"),v.innerHTML=R,C=m(),g=h("p"),g.textContent=V,j=m(),W(b.$$.fragment),k=m(),H=h("br"),M=m(),y=h("h3"),y.innerHTML=D,P=m(),W(_.$$.fragment),q=m(),I=h("br"),this.h()},l(e){t=d(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(t)!=="svelte-ccveyw"&&(t.innerHTML=f),l=c(e),r=d(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(r)!=="svelte-1a32dp5"&&(r.textContent=i),s=c(e),u=d(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(u)!=="svelte-1pkgjek"&&(u.textContent=E),x=c(e),p=d(e,"H2",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(p)!=="svelte-1bvq07b"&&(p.innerHTML=O),T=c(e),v=d(e,"H3",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(v)!=="svelte-e8jefg"&&(v.innerHTML=R),C=c(e),g=d(e,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(g)!=="svelte-kfe8d6"&&(g.textContent=V),j=c(e),Y(b.$$.fragment,e),k=c(e),H=d(e,"BR",{}),M=c(e),y=d(e,"H3",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),w(y)!=="svelte-4a9ujv"&&(y.innerHTML=D),P=c(e),Y(_.$$.fragment,e),q=c(e),I=d(e,"BR",{}),this.h()},h(){S(t,"id","introduction"),S(p,"id","video"),S(v,"id","authentication-using-hand-gesture"),S(y,"id","authentication-using-body-movement")},m(e,a){n(e,t,a),n(e,l,a),n(e,r,a),n(e,s,a),n(e,u,a),n(e,x,a),n(e,p,a),n(e,T,a),n(e,v,a),n(e,C,a),n(e,g,a),n(e,j,a),B(b,e,a),n(e,k,a),n(e,H,a),n(e,M,a),n(e,y,a),n(e,P,a),B(_,e,a),n(e,q,a),n(e,I,a),L=!0},p:Q,i(e){L||(U(b.$$.fragment,e),U(_.$$.fragment,e),L=!0)},o(e){Z(b.$$.fragment,e),Z(_.$$.fragment,e),L=!1},d(e){e&&(o(t),o(l),o(r),o(s),o(u),o(x),o(p),o(T),o(v),o(C),o(g),o(j),o(k),o(H),o(M),o(y),o(P),o(q),o(I)),z(b,e),z(_,e)}}}function ne($){let t,f;const l=[$[0],K];let r={$$slots:{default:[ie]},$$scope:{ctx:$}};for(let i=0;i<l.length;i+=1)r=A(r,l[i]);return t=new te({props:r}),{c(){W(t.$$.fragment)},l(i){Y(t.$$.fragment,i)},m(i,s){B(t,i,s),f=!0},p(i,[s]){const u=s&1?ae(l,[s&1&&F(i[0]),s&0&&F(K)]):{};s&2&&(u.$$scope={dirty:s,ctx:i}),t.$set(u)},i(i){f||(U(t.$$.fragment,i),f=!0)},o(i){Z(t.$$.fragment,i),f=!1},d(i){z(t,i)}}}const K={title:"Towards a Gratifying Interactive Modality for Smart Environments based on Ubiquitous Sensing (BSc.
