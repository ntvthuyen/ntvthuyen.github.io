To address this, Workpackage 2 of a five-member research team developed a VR-based pilot training prototype in collaboration with Singapore Airlines,
recreating complex approach scenarios with injected threats and errors for scalable, self-directed pilot training.
Shout out for my teammates who have been working on this for years.
I joined later to support the evaluation phase and further contribute to refining and expanding the systemâ€™s design, and planed the paper writing.`;return{c(){e=d("p"),e.innerHTML=r,s=C(),n=d("p"),n.textContent=t},l(a){e=u(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(e)!=="svelte-zub5wc"&&(e.innerHTML=r),s=k(a),n=u(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(n)!=="svelte-xprlq3"&&(n.textContent=t)},m(a,i){l(a,e,i),l(a,s,i),l(a,n,i)},p:v,d(a){a&&(m(e),m(s),m(n))}}}function R(o){let e,r;const s=[o[0],_];let n={$$slots:{default:[M]},$$scope:{ctx:o}};for(let t=0;t<s.length;t+=1)n=p(n,s[t]);return e=new q({props:n}),{c(){y(e.$$.fragment)},l(t){T(e.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,a){$(e,t,a),r=!0},p(t,[a]){const i=a&1?S(s,[a&1&&g(t[0]),a&0&&g(_)]):{};a&2&&(i.$$scope={dirty:a,ctx:t}),e.$set(i)},i(t){r||(w(e.$$.fragment,t),r=!0)},o(t){P(e.$$.fragment,t),r=!1},d(t){j(e,t)}}}const _={title:"VR Competency-Based Pilot Training for Threat and Error Management",image:"/assets/vrdemo.jpg",summary:"VR Competency-Based Pilot Training for Threat and Error Management",created:"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z",updated:"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z",published:"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z",tags:["Research","Project","Aviation","Training"],images:[],slug:"/projects/vrtrainingsimulator/+page.svelte.md",path:"/projects/vrtrainingsimulator",toc:!1};function A(o,e,r){return o.$$set=s=>{r(0,e=p(p({},e),c(s)))},e=c(e),[e]}class E extends b{constructor(e){super(),x(this,e,A,R,h,{})}}export{E as component};
