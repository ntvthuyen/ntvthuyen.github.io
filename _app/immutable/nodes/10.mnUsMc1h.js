To address this, Workpackage 2 of a five-member research team developed a VR-based pilot training prototype in collaboration with Singapore Airlines,
recreating complex approach scenarios with injected threats and errors for scalable, self-directed pilot training.
Shout out for my teammates who have been working on this for years.
I joined later to support the evaluation phase and further contribute to refining and expanding the system’s design, and planed the paper writing.`,n,o,x='<a href="#publication">Publication</a>',c,l,T='2025 VR Competency-Based Pilot Training for Threat and Error Management, In SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 XR (SA XR ’25), December 15–18, 2025, Hong Kong, Hong Kong. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3761667.3761949" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer external" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1145/3761667.3761949</a>';return{c(){e=f("p"),e.innerHTML=s,i=_(),r=f("p"),r.textContent=t,n=_(),o=f("h1"),o.innerHTML=x,c=_(),l=f("p"),l.innerHTML=T,this.h()},l(a){e=g(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),h(e)!=="svelte-zub5wc"&&(e.innerHTML=s),i=v(a),r=g(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),h(r)!=="svelte-xprlq3"&&(r.textContent=t),n=v(a),o=g(a,"H1",{id:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),h(o)!=="svelte-ob5tjm"&&(o.innerHTML=x),c=v(a),l=g(a,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),h(l)!=="svelte-6pvu02"&&(l.innerHTML=T),this.h()},h(){q(o,"id","publication")},m(a,p){m(a,e,p),m(a,i,p),m(a,r,p),m(a,n,p),m(a,o,p),m(a,c,p),m(a,l,p)},p:R,d(a){a&&(u(e),u(i),u(r),u(n),u(o),u(c),u(l))}}}function V(d){let e,s;const i=[d[0],H];let r={$$slots:{default:[G]},$$scope:{ctx:d}};for(let t=0;t<i.length;t+=1)r=b(r,i[t]);return e=new I({props:r}),{c(){$(e.$$.fragment)},l(t){j(e.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,n){A(e,t,n),s=!0},p(t,[n]){const o=n&1?B(i,[n&1&&y(t[0]),n&0&&y(H)]):{};n&2&&(o.$$scope={dirty:n,ctx:t}),e.$set(o)},i(t){s||(S(e.$$.fragment,t),s=!0)},o(t){k(e.$$.fragment,t),s=!1},d(t){L(e,t)}}}const H={title:"(SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 XR) VR Competency-Based Pilot Training for Threat and Error Management",image:"/assets/vrdemo.jpg",summary:"VR Competency-Based Pilot Training for Threat and Error Management",created:"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z",updated:"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z",published:"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z",tags:["Research","Project","Aviation","Training"],images:[],slug:"/projects/vrtrainingsimulator/+page.svelte.md",path:"/projects/vrtrainingsimulator",toc:[{depth:1,slug:"publication",title:"Publication"}]};function E(d,e,s){return d.$$set=i=>{s(0,e=b(b({},e),P(i)))},e=P(e),[e]}class K extends w{constructor(e){super(),M(this,e,E,V,C,{})}}export{K as component};
