# About me!

My name is Vinh-Thuyen.

You can pronounce my name by saying “thu” and “yen” as fast as possible. Thuyên has many meanings in Chinese (around 19 different characters), with both negative and positive interpretations, and I love all of them. However, my mom wanted to name me after a person named Han Thuyen (韓詮), so 詮 is the primary meaning, as I understand it.

I hold a BSc (APCS program) and a Msc degree in Computer Science. I am currently a Research Engineer at the SIA–NUS Corporate Laboratory at IORA, and I am actively working toward gaining admission to a PhD program this year. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at MEILab, City University of Hong Kong (CityU).

My main research interests are Human–Computer Interaction and Information & Knowledge Management. I have broad experience and knowledge in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other computer-related fields.

I love computers, Linux, coding, learning, games, Dota, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, manga, playing the guitar, math rock, running, swimming, and penguins.
