[Ahmad Iqbal Bin Othman](https://siacorplab.nus.edu.sg/people/ahmad-iqbal-bin-othman/) crafted this beautiful teaser!

Full Flight Simulators are costly and limited in availability. 
To address this, Workpackage 2 of a five-member research team developed a VR-based pilot training prototype in collaboration with Singapore Airlines, 
recreating complex approach scenarios with injected threats and errors for scalable, self-directed pilot training. 
Shout out for my teammates who have been working on this for years.
I joined later to support the evaluation phase and further contribute to refining and expanding the system’s design, and planed the paper writing.
