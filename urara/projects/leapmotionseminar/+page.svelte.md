## Introduction
This project was a part of 3D visualization and game development course in 2020, my third year at university. 

We built this project using Unity 3D and leap motion V4 for introducing my friend to the hand tracking device.

In this project, player is able to:

- Grabbing weapons

- Hitting enemies with fireball

- And ... Moving Unity-chan around... grab, pull or push her
